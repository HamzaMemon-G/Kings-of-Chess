            The chessboard is a square grid of 64 squares, alternating in color
            between light and dark.
          </li>
          <li>
            The game is played between two opponents, each starting with 16
            pieces of different types.
          </li>
          <li>
            The objective of the game is to checkmate your opponent's king by
            putting it in a position <br />
            where it is under attack and cannot escape capture.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each piece moves in a unique way, and capturing an opponent's piece
            involves moving your <br />
            own piece to the square occupied by the opponent's piece.
          </li>
          <li>
            Players take turns moving their pieces, and a game can end in a win,
            loss, or draw.
          </li>
